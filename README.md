# Learning Node.js 
Following a Udemy course created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller

## Module 1
Working with simple routing, modules, http, and the filesystem.

## Module 2
Learned what Express.js is and how it make Node.js easier and cleaner to write.
Learned about the basics of Express.js routing, making views, and hosting private/public files.

## Module 3
Learned how to manage data, render dynamic content in a view, and use templating engine like pug, ejs, and hbs.  
For all the templating engines, learned how to render conditionals, using layouts/includes and more.

## Module 4
Learned about the differences between the models, views, and how the data interacts between the different aspects. 

## Module 5
Added more routes, reorganized the so the code was more understandable and to create a better separation of concerns around the files.

_Note_ From here on out, I will be creating separate branches for each module as copying the folders is getting redundent.

## Module 6
